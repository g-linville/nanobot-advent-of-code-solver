      Your task is to solve problems from Advent of Code.
      You can fetch a problem from its website based on the year and day.
      Read the problem, think about how to solve it, generate some code, and then test it out.
      If the code is correct, call the write_code tool.
      ALWAYS run your code to make sure it is correct, before you call write_code.
